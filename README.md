## 1. Understanding Data

### a. Hypothesis Generation
Hypothesis generation involves identifying the key questions or patterns you want to explore with the dataset. This step helps define the scope and objectives of the analysis.

### b. Getting the System Ready and Loading the Data
Here, the necessary libraries are installed, and the dataset is loaded for analysis. Data preparation steps such as data cleaning and preprocessing are also covered.

### c. Dataset Structure and Content
This section describes the structure of the dataset, including the columns, types of variables, and how they relate to the forecasting task.

### d. Feature Extraction
Feature extraction involves identifying and selecting key features or variables from the dataset that will be used for building the forecasting models.

### e. Exploratory Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the underlying patterns in the dataset, including visualizations and basic statistical analysis.

## 2. Forecasting Using Multiple Modeling Techniques

### i. Splitting Data into Training and Validation Part
Data is split into training and validation datasets. The training set is used for model training, and the validation set is used for model evaluation.

### ii. Modeling Techniques
Various forecasting techniques are discussed, each suited for different aspects of time series data. The models used include Holt’s Linear Trend Model, Holt-Winter’s Model, ARIMA, and SARIMAX.

### iii. Holt’s Linear Trend Model on Daily Time Series
Holt’s linear trend model is used to forecast time series data with a linear trend. This technique accounts for both the level and the trend in the data.

### iv. Holt Winter’s Model on Daily Time Series
The Holt-Winter’s model extends Holt’s model by adding seasonality. It is applied to time series data with both trend and seasonality components.

### v. Introduction to ARIMA Model
The ARIMA model is introduced as a powerful forecasting method for time series data that incorporates auto-regression, differencing, and moving average components.

### vi. Parameter Tuning for ARIMA Model
This section discusses how to tune the parameters of the ARIMA model (p, d, q) for optimal forecasting performance.

### vii. SARIMAX Model on Daily Time Series
The SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model is applied to time series data with both seasonality and external variables (exogenous regressors).
